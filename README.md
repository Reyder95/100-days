# 100 Days of Code

This is a small project that I work on most days of the week to better my front end skills in terms of placement and mobile responsiveness.

It follows the 100 small projects you can find [here](https://dev.to/bigsondev/100-free-frontend-challenges-3f0).

## Project Details
This project is being built with React/Nextjs, and Material UI for the CSS design. 

I believe the original intent of the frontend challenges was to use them with raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, because I am using React, I'm trying to incorporate state into my application to think about how someone might design this professionally.
